    use or disclose any Confidential Information, except as necessary for the
    exercise of its rights under this Agreement. Licensee will use all best

    disclosure, but in no event less than the efforts that it ordinarily uses
    with respect to its own confidential information of similar importance.

    except for any of its employees and contractors who need to know such
    Confidential Information for the exercise of Licensee’s rights under this

    this Agreement. Licensee shall provide prompt notice to Company of any
    unauthorized use, disclosure or access to any Confidential Information.

    pursuant to this Agreement without the prior written consent of Company.
